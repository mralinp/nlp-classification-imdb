# nlp-classification-imdb

## Intro
The goal of this project is getting familiar with 'classification', by solving a natural language processing problem. Here we have a dataset in which any user has been written his/her oppinion about a movie. The sentences that users written has a posetive or nagative meaning that we can say whether they like the movie or not. each sentence has been read by a human and he/she labeled the data with 0 and 1 which means possetive or negative oppinion.

We have collected 3 kindes of datasets, testing, training and a validation dataset. we wanted you to first, build a feature vector of the written sentences and then train your classificator with the given datasets and then use your trained classificator to label the validation dataset sentences.
